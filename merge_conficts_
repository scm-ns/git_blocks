In git a branch can be merged into the branch you are currently working on by using 
	1) pull 
	2) fetch + merge

1) pull is just a short hand for fetch + merge . 
	pull gets the branch and tries to auto merge , ie if the remote changes and the local 
	changes	do not over lap, then the branch is merged automatically. 
	But if there are overlapping change
	then you will have to do a manual merge resolution. 
	In a manual merge resolution , go through the files . See where a distinct signature , 
	with HEAD the commit sha is present . Edit the files to remove the signature and
	choose the desired changes . 
	After repeating this step for all the files with a merge conflict, just commit it and now
	you are out of the merge phase


	Example
	
	      C - D - E - I - J  (remote)
	     / 	
	A - B 
	     \
	      F - G - H (local)

	merge remote to local


		
	      C - D - E - I - J  - L  - M 			(remote)
	     / 			\ 
	A - B  			 \
	     \ 			  \
	      F - G - H - - - - -  K - N - O 			(local) 
				 
				     ^ 
				     Future work after the merge will be restricted to the branch you are in

	After the  pull you start working at K
