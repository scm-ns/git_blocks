Git uses sha1 hash algo to indentify each of its commits. The hash function tries to prevent 
collisions between the inserted items. 

Git uses a combination of items to create the sha1sum used to mark the commit. 
They are : 
	- the sha1sum identifying the source tree of the commit
	- the parent commit sha1
	- author info
	- commiter info
	- commit message 

Git then adds a null byte , a string "commit" and the number of bytes in the combination above and
feeds it into the sha1 algorithm to produce the commit

in bash : 

(printf "commit %s\0" $(git cat-file commit HEAD | wc -c); git cat-file commit HEAD) | sha1sum

Here 	
	printf - acts like the c printf
	wc -c - count the number of bytes in the string piped into it
	sha1sum - get the sha1sum for the values piped in
